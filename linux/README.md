### Linux Self Assessment

<details>
<summary>What is your experience with Linux?</summary><br><b>

Only you know :)

For example:
* Administration
* Troubleshooting & Debugging
* Storage
* Networking
* Development
* Deployments
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain what each of the following commands does and give an example on how to use it:

  * touch
  * ls
  * rm
  * cat
  * cp
  * mkdir
  * pwd
  * cd
</summary><br><b>

  * touch - update file's timestamp. More commonly used for creating files
  * ls - listing files and directories
  * rm - remove files and directories
  * cat - create, view and concatenate files
  * cp - copy files and directories
  * mkdir - create directories
  * pwd - print current working directory (= at what path the user currently located)
  * cd - change directory
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What each of the following commands does?

  * cd /
  * cd ~
  * cd
  * cd ..
  * cd .
  * cd -
</summary><br><b>

  * cd / -> change to the root directory
  * cd ~ -> change to your home directory
  * cd -> change to your home directory
  * cd .. -> change to the directory above your current i.e parent directory
  * cd . -> change to the directory you currently in
  * cd - -> change to the last visited path
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Some of the commands in the previous question can be run with the -r/-R flag. What does it do? Give an example to when you would use it</summary><br><b>

The -r (or -R in some commands) flag allows the user to run a certain command recursively. For example, listing all the files under the following tree is possible when done recursively (`ls -R`):

/dir1/
  dir2/
    file1
    file2
  dir3/
    file3

To list all the files, one can run `ls -R /dir1`

### Intermediate
<details>
<summary><b>1</b>.How delete all files in a directory except one filename:


</summary><br><b>

  * ls -a
  * rm -f [filename]
  * rm -v !("filename.extension")
</b></details>
